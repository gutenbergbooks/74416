<small>INTELLIGENCE AND PROTEUS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There seems not to exist a word—for
words are old while meanings may be
new—which answers exactly to what
I shall speak of as <em>Intelligence</em>. But
space being short for what has to be
said, I will not waste any in preliminary
definitions. That which I mean by
Intelligence will become evident by
what I expect from its presence and
attribute to its absence. I start from
the assumption that it already exists,
however insufficiently; and I deduce
from what it has done that its nature
is to intensify and extend. Whether
this will be witnessed in the near
future, or whether it may be checked
by adverse circumstances, is no concern
of mine. Writers of this series, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
several others besides, have enlarged
on the political and economic contingencies
to which Intelligence, or
persons presumed to have it, seem
likely to be exposed. Whether Intelligence
may become the weapon of a
dominant caste, as was the hope of
Comte, of Renan, and, at one moment,
of Mr. H. G. Wells; or whether, as
proposed by M. Charles Maurras, Intelligence
shall be honoured with a
subordinate function in some sort of
Fascist State, I am inadequate to
judge. Nor do I even feel certain that
history has shown, or economic theory
demonstrated, that Intelligence can be
bullied or starved out of existence.
Meanwhile let me confess that what
I have to say about the Future of Intelligence
is the expression as much of
my hopes as of my convictions, both,
however, arising from a longish experience
of changes already brought about,
and changes beginning to be brought
about, by the particular, and perhaps
rather modern, something I mean by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
<em>Intelligence</em>. What <em>I</em> mean, and what,
under restriction to that meaning, appears
<em>to me</em> likely or desirable. By
underlining these personal pronouns, I
am able to forestall the mention of
one great change which Intelligence is
already initiating, namely, the recognition
and avowal that what one thinks
(as distinguished from what primers,
manuals and other authorities have
taught one to believe) is—well, <em>just
what one does think</em>, and neither the
consensus of human opinion nor the
revelation of the Deity’s irrefragable
truth.</p>

<p>Returning to the word <em>Intelligence</em>,
the meaning I attach to it will become
sooner obvious by clearing away some
misconceptions thereof which may occur
to my reader. And first: The Intelligence
whose future interests me is
not the same thing as the <em>Intelligentsia</em>.
Those of us who belong to that class
presumably possess <em>Intelligence</em>, since
we live, or try to live, by its exercise.
But it is no monopoly of ours, nor do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
we always employ it in the manner
which answers to my meaning. For
living on or by its employment may, as
is often seen among men of science and
philosophers, result in their capital of
natural Intelligence being sunk in a
few enterprises of especial value, leaving
them, as in the notorious case of
Dr. Faust, but a scanty balance for
current use and pleasure. I have
brought in the word <em>pleasure</em> because
the pleasantness of its varied exercise
is one of the chief characteristics of
what I mean by <em>Intelligence</em>, fostering
that nimbleness, elasticity, hence also
pervasiveness, which makes it a chief
factor of human progress, as well as
one of progressive mankind’s indisputable
marks and unalienable rewards.
Now these same pleasant properties, so
often sacrificed by very studious persons,
turn Intelligence into the stock-in-trade
(eked out with plentiful surrogates)
of that other branch of the
<em>Intelligentsia</em>, those who make a livelihood
by living down to their readers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
relieving their boredom, lapping their
thick skins in sentimentality, and keeping
up the sooty flame of their collective
passions; for alas, the Man of Letters
is tempted to serve his public not
merely as an unconsidered jester but
as a respected moral guide.</p>

<p>Thus it comes about that we of the
<em>Intelligentsia</em> cannot stand as faultless
specimens of Intelligence. Besides, our
facility for self-expression and our
habit of holding forth unchecked combine
to exaggerate, stereotype and warp
our best ideas: only think of Carlyle
and Ruskin, let alone Tolstoy and
Nietzsche!</p>

<p>Having so far established what I do
<em>not</em> mean by Intelligence, and before
entering on discussion of Intelligence’s
future achievements, it seems fitting
to say a word or two about Proteus,
to whom this little treatise is consecrated.
It is so, I confess, partly because
I am attracted by the classical
titles, <cite>Dædalus</cite>, <cite>Icarus</cite>, <cite>Tantalus</cite>, of
my predecessors, and then because, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
described by Virgil, Proteus is to me
one of the most engaging figures of
mythology: ... “<span lang="la">Ille, suae contra
non immemor artis, omnia transformat
sese in miracula rerum, ignemque,
horribilem feram, fluviumque liquentem</span>....”</p>

<p>But here again I must forestall
another wrong identification likely to
jump into the reader’s mind: to wit,
of Proteus with Intelligence. On the
contrary: Proteus, multiform and ever-elusive,
represents that which Intelligence
(lighter equipped than specialized
Intellect for such rapid hunts) can
sometimes catch sight of and, for however
brief a contact, sometimes even
clutch. Proteus, in my mythology, is
the mysterious whole which we know
must exist, but know not how to
descry: Reality. For, whatever else
we may believe it to be, Reality when
thus partially revealed, is never twice
the same. Nor merely because of
what we call waxing and waning,
growth and decay, and whatever other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
phases of individual and racial transformation
biology has made us superficially
familiar with. There may
well be some πάντα ῤεῖ outside and
irrespective of our thoughts; indeed,
it may have been in miming the universal
flux that our thoughts themselves
have grown <em>protean</em>. Look, for
instance, at that strange (well named
<em>auxiliary</em>) verb whereby we testify belief
in reality, <i lang="la">esse</i>, <em>to be</em>; which holds
in its emptiness the possibility of all
qualities and happenings and implies
in its assertion of mere blank existence
the assurance of continual change: a
future and past. For, whenever we
speak of what we call a <em>thing</em>, its mere
name, like the name of Virgil’s Proteus,
is a spell making us witness aspect
after aspect, take stock of relation
after relation, admit likelihood after
likelihood. And our belief in that
thing’s reality, in its being <em>that thing</em>
and no other, means that it has had
a certain, however unknown; past, and
will have a more or less certain future.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
In this sense <em>Reality</em>, the fact of aspects
perceived, remembered and expected
in regularly connected sequences and
combinations, <em>that</em> is what I mean by
Proteus. Maybe that Proteus does not
change at all except in our narrow, and
shifting, field of vision. Maybe that
the multiform Virgilian Proteus might
turn out to undergo but one first and
last transformation, into that great
auxiliary <i lang="la">esse</i>, <em>to be</em>, holding in its stark
emptiness all that, for us, is things and
happenings.... Such a transcendent
and sole real Reality I leave to metaphysicians,
not without wondering
secretly whence, save from occasional
experience of this (to them) unreal
Proteus, they ever got to think about
Reality at all.</p>

<p>So, dealing in this shallow treatise
solely with such (even if spurious)
Reality as Proteus represents, I need
now only justify my outrageous claim
that mere Intelligence can have any
privileged intercourse therewith. My
ground for saying so is that specialized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
intellect screws its marvellous lenses
down on only a single, and <em>singled out</em>,
aspect of Reality; employs subtle
reagents revealing only the properties
for which they have been devised.
Moreover, that the world of regular,
foretellable sequences which science
constructs is a map teaching us why
to turn to the right or the left, but not
a moving slice of the landscape we are
moving in. Instead of which mere
Intelligence, with its rule-of-thumb
logic and well-nigh automatic movements,
may be fairly fitted, not indeed
to inventory and schedule separate
items of Proteus’ multifold embodiments,
but to keep us aware that
Proteus is there at that eternal game of
his: changing his aspects perpetually,
whether you watch him or not, nay,
changing aspect by the very fact of
your watching him.</p>

<p>This may suggest that Intelligence is
never at rest; and no more it is. But
its movements being responsive to what
strikes it from outside, are, just as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
outside’s own ways, orderly, and such
as organize themselves into regular
rhythms of sameness and diversity.
For Proteus is absolutely unexpected
only to persons like Virgil’s Aristæus
who, you must remember, was so hide-bound
in his business of <em>h</em>oney-making
(alter one letter, you won’t alter my
meaning!) as to be wholly unaware
that his own caddish behaviour had
occasioned the death of Eurydice and
so remarkable an event as the Descent
of Orpheus into Hell. Practical people
like that are nearly always astonished
and dismayed when confronted with
Proteus; “they had forgotten....”
Now Intelligence is as much memory as
perception; and for it there is always
in the transformations it is watching
something familiar which carries it
back to what it has already witnessed,
and forwards, expectantly, to something
it may be going to witness. Hence
to Intelligence there is never mere
repetition, just as there is never utter
novelty. And its frequent doubts are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
always conditioned by its habitual beliefs.
That explains why Intelligence
is so chock-full of prejudices, as all
those are aware who have ever asked it
to accept miracles and ghosts on their
testimony or on someone else’s authority.
Such people exclaim at the sceptic’s
blindness to evidence, because they
do not know that doubting and even
denying are part of Intelligence’s active
rhythm of grasping and acquiescing; a
process of assimilation and elimination
in which the already experienced and
accepted selects that which shall be
accepted or rejected. Moreover, such
selective action often expresses itself
in the most impertinent (because most
pertinent) queries, as: “Now how
would you explain that?” “In what
sense are you using that word?” etc.,
etc., etc. Queries, all of them, which
in their exasperating amateurishness
have probably done more than the
elaborate arguments of specialized Intellect
to shoo away some of the many
Chimæras, Entities, and Essences,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
which, as Rabelais already remarked,
had gone on <i lang="la">bombinating in vacuo</i>
through the resounding spaciousness of
philosophy and science, leaving behind
only the fainter buzz of <em>Historical and
Economic Laws</em>, <em>Entelechies</em>, <em>Teleologies</em>
and <em>Vital Elans</em>. It was, I take
it, Intelligence which first scoffed in
Molière’s play at opium’s <cite lang="la">Virtus
Dormitiva</cite>....</p>

<p>At this point a parenthesis must be
opened on account of a reader asking,
not impertinently, whether what I have
been talking of under the name of
Intelligence is not plain <em>Common Sense</em>.
Yes; but also <em>No</em>. Since, on behalf of
practicality, Common Sense usually
warns us off from just such questions
as Intelligence should deal with. So
one might say that Intelligence is a
kind of Common Sense, but applied to
uncommon (not common or garden!)
subjects, and as yet, alas, only by
rather uncommon people.</p>

<p>If Proteus be taken to represent that
Reality which all save metaphysicians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
believe to be real, he represents especially
that half of it which I have (elsewhere)
called <em>Otherness</em>, that is to say,
whatever is not <em>ourself</em>. And just as
the essential, unshareable <em>ourself</em> is
what we feel, to wit: moods, passions,
efforts, hope and fear, liking and disliking;
so the <em>not-ourself</em> (other persons
as well as other things, and even
our own personalities when viewed as if
they were not our own)—the <em>Otherness</em>
in short, is, on the contrary, <em>seen</em>,
because it is outside us. Seen by the
mental eye of Intelligence, which, like
the bodily one, moves in every direction
and focuses to all distances, thereby
informing us of the proportions and
relations of whatever is not ourself, and
following step by step the actions
which are not our own. And though
it must borrow the lenses of Science
(which centuries of thinkers cut and
polished) before it can know things in
their microscopic detail or their astronomical
remoteness, yet with no aid
save everyday experience, Intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
suffices to teach us the most important
and most overlooked fact concerning
that Reality which is <em>Otherness</em>: namely,
that it has ways of its own and does
not exist merely to suit our likings.</p>

<p>The habit of taking “otherness”
into account, and a wider and wider
circle thereof, might serve as a rough
test of Intelligence and of its progress:
young children, as is notorious, referring
everything to themselves; and
“uneducated” people, from the narrowness
of their knowledge, rarely conceiving
anything beyond their own
personal experience. At the risk of
incurring the same criticism, I hazard
my own impression that the dominance
of possessive pronouns, the restriction
of interest to one’s own history and
circle of acquaintances, has become less
usual among “educated” persons.</p>

<p>Similarly, that there is getting to be
something rather old-fashioned about
settling general questions on the strength
of single personal experiences. Except
where strong likes and dislikes come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
into play, it is rarer than formerly
to hear (shall we say?) divorce condemned
because of the sad case of
Mrs. Blank; or the eight-hours day
rejected on account of last harvest having
been soaked; or the practical utility
of a classical education justified by
the career of Mr. Gladstone. Modes of
thought like this seem to be (slowly!)
disappearing in the wake of the anecdote-mongering
and epigram-and-joke
button-holing of ancient bores who
may have been brilliant conversationalists
at Meredithian dinner-tables. And
when one thinks of it: was not such
the substance of much of our grandparents’
wit and wisdom? Nay, a
little further back did not “gentlemen”
ask the ladies riddles after themselves
exchanging smutty <i>Joe Millers</i> over
their wine? And behold! there opens
up a vista of euphuism, of pedantic
discussions, of “<span lang="fr">sonnet, c’est un sonnet</span>,”
of “<span lang="la">deliciæ eruditorum</span>,” and
“<span lang="la">facetiæ”</span>; boredom incalculable back
through Hôtels de Rambouillets and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Medicean academies to Courts of Love
and the stale scurrilities of Shakespearian
clowns.... Nay, was not
Shakespeare himself ready to adorn
with supremest poetry and philosophy
stories often preposterously cock-and-bull?
Which makes one suspect that
Intelligence, in the sense in which I
have been using the word, is of amazingly
recent growth; and that the
people of the past, superior though
they may have been in genius, wit,
humour, and even wisdom, would have
struck us (and we shall doubtless
strike future generations) as decidedly
stupid.</p>

<p>For instance (returning to Proteus!),
in their capacity of <em>thinking in terms
of change</em>. This seems an <em>intrinsic part
of thinking in terms of otherness</em>; yet,
as, a fact, it dates only from the days
of Montesquieu, Voltaire, Gibbon and
Condorcet. This last name brings
home that until the eighteenth century
the only Future which people thought
about was the Future in Heaven or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Hell. The importance of the latter
alternative explains quite sufficiently
why no interest was left over for any
other after-life, to wit, that of unborn
generations. Indeed, the sway of religious
conceptions accounts also for
our ancestors having been no less cut
off from the Past and replacing it
(as their painters dressed Abraham or
Cæsar in Renaissance costume) by the
Present. For all religion tends to
think <i lang="la">sub specie æternitatis</i>, as of the
god who is sacrificed afresh at every
celebration, and who consecrates the
routine of the seasons and the seasonal
monotony of agriculture and pastoral
life; whence, no doubt, the persistence
of the amazing fallacy <em>that there is
nothing new under the sun</em>, with its
corollary that there ought to be nothing
not <em>old</em>. Whence also the double
superstition (till Science broke in with
something different!) of chewing and
rechewing the cud of Scripture and the
Classics. With, in turn, the practical
results that Milton’s Puritans modelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
themselves on Joshua and Gideon; and
frilled and waistcoated French Revolutionaries
postured as heroes of Plutarch.
Why, at this very moment do we not
see the rods and axes of antique hangmen
figuring (not merely in figurative
manner!) as emblems of post-war Italy,
itself identified (to the neglect of
schools and irrigation works) with a
particularly high and palmy Rome?
Rome! to rule which squalid mediæval
village Dante called on a <em>Cæsar</em> who was
a <em>Kaiser</em> elected by German feudatories;
Rome, which we may take as a <i lang="la">reductio
ad absurdum</i> of the refusal to realize
that Past is Past and Present is Present.
Which is perhaps the only “Lesson of
History”; and whose application would
dissolve many mythical alloys of conflicting
nations welded together by the
passionate white-heat of a name: England,
France, America, Christianity,
and nowadays, I fear, also Socialism,
nations, and creeds concerning which,
when asked for our allegiance, we
have need to inquire: In which of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
phases, which of its characteristics and
embodiments?</p>

<p>For Intelligence warns us that we
are dealing with Proteus, with him
of ceaseless change. Not with the
eternal, immutable divinities to whom
our forebears brought their sometimes
quaint and lovely, but, quite
as often, obscene and grisly oblations.</p>

<p>But while ignoring distinctions
between Past and Present, even our
nearer ancestors conducted much of
their thinking in elaborate water-tight
compartments; for they conceived of
“Truth” as a battleship, continually
exposed to the murderous broadsides
of “Error.” Of these hermetic
partitions, say, between <em>Faith</em> and
<em>Reason</em>, <em>Body</em> and <em>Soul</em>, or <em>Good</em> and
<em>Evil</em>, Intelligence has already rammed
in a number, without drowning us.
<em>Error</em> itself has lost its capital E, being
usually called <em>Mistake</em>. And, what
is more important, we have begun to
notice that it and <em>Truth</em> are not at all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
irreconcilable, but cradled originally
together, and sometimes intermarrying,
with mixed or alternating generations,
as by Mendelian rules; but very rarely,
either Truth or Error, affording us a
pure breed.</p>

<p>These examples will have justified,
I trust, my contention that Intelligence
is specially fitted to deal with Change.
Not to praise or blame it after mature
deliberation, like solemn and sedentary
Reason; still less to filter concrete
realities into immutable, because purely
abstract, entities, which is the business
of scientific thought; but just to perceive
change on its passage and in so
far help us to make the best of its
coming.</p>

<p>Need one add that Intelligence is
far more liable to mistakes than either
“Reason” or “Logic”? But its mistakes,
though so much more numerous,
are, methinks, less massively enthroned
and less likely to block the
way than theirs, for there is something
self-satisfied and without appeal about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
“Reason” and “Logic”: does not
the one issue “dictates” and the other
enunciate “laws”? Whereas the mistakes
which Intelligence commits to-day,
it will, in its light-hearted way,
correct to-morrow, being as little
ashamed of revokes as its disconcerting
friend Proteus is of transformations.
Of course, Intelligence <em>is</em> rather irresponsible
and, one might add, cannot
help being so because it is essentially
<em>responsive</em>. Like the human eye (to
which I have compared it) Intelligence
turns to whichever side the light comes
from, adjusting itself, in discursive,
often desultory fashion, to all manner
of directions and distances, comparing
and measuring with unabashed slovenliness,
extracting the qualities which
strike it and hastening on to connect
them with something it was struck by
before. Being thus rapidly responsive,
Intelligence may often, I admit, seem
<em>on the pounce</em>, and more so than politeness
warrants. But it can also take its
time, poise circling round and round,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
and reverse its movement, because it is
never motionless and always able to
readjust its balance.</p>

<p>Such do I see Intelligence in those
who possess it; such do I feel it, on
some delightful occasions, in myself.
Such also I frequently notice it failing
to make itself agreeable to some kinds
of persons. Those who take a just
pride in Reason or Logic are often a
little ruffled; or else, as Wagner said
of Mozart, they find Intelligence just
a little <i lang="de">frivol</i>. But in the long run
they recognize an ally; and their
conscious superiority makes them
indulgent. Not so with people—I
might have said Peoples—who happen
to be indulging in the glorious
unimpeded violence of collective
passions, specially those which are magnanimous
and cruel, as, for instance,
in war time, when a conscientious
objector may come off better than an
intelligent one.</p>

<p>In like fashion Intelligence’s passionate
pleasure in dealing with <em>Otherness</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and in looking out for Proteus,
Intelligence’s frequent indifference to
<em>here</em> and <em>now</em>, disrespect to <em>self</em> and
refusal to regard <em>means</em> as <em>ends</em>—all
this renders it unpopular with those
practical-minded men who are bent on
personal advantage and on outstripping
competitors in the great race to <em>Nowhere</em>.
These acute persons are quite
aware that Intelligence might make
an invaluable slave, only you cannot
keep its nose, with any regularity, to
the grindstone. In default of such
practical usefulness it may be worth
hiring, as one buys a yacht or an old
master, for a mark of wealth and being
in the know. But let us have none of
your <em>whys</em> and <em>wherefores</em>! Besides,
the Rulers of Men have by this time
mostly recognized that Intelligence is
harder to deal with than any number
of High Principles, for you cannot
hope to bamboozle it into serving you
unawares.</p>

<p>But Intelligence, though thus in
some quarters deservedly unpopular is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
adored by all who have it; and that
is the reason why, once it has got a
footing in the world, it is bound to
increase and multiply and eventually
conquer its promised land.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br>
<small>PROTEUS AND ETHICS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I have just come across a passage from
Huxley’s famous <cite lang="fr">Romanes Lecture</cite>,
read thirty years ago and long since forgotten;
and which has brought home
to me all our elusive Proteus has been
doing in the domain of ethics; moreover
the share of Intelligence in confirming
those changes. Huxley is pointing out
a fact which he finds disconcerting,
namely, “that ethical nature, while
born of cosmic nature, is necessarily
at enmity with its parent.” The
allusion to the harmony reigning in
Victorian families may make one
smile, like some well-bred Du Maurier
illustration. But how those words
bring back what some of us are old
enough to have suffered in days when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Free Thought drew a terrifying line
between religious dogmas and moral
ones, clinging to these to steady itself
after jettisoning the others! One’s
youthful deistic anguish (as cruel, perhaps,
as any believer’s sense of God’s
forsaking him) at discarding God for
insufficient morality, was merely transferred
to one’s terms with Huxley’s
ogre Cosmos, devouring the moral instincts
itself had begotten. Occupied as
my studies then were with art-history,
I can remember wrestling with the
horrid inconsistency of the art of
Michael Angelo and Rafael having
arisen in a civilization described by
Taine as partaking of the brothel and
the cut-throat’s den. And I remember
the heavenly relief of hitting on the
notion that, since such art is not born
in a day, it must have been begotten
and incubated during the Franciscan
Age, immune from all Borgian infections.
Of course, the generation
immediately younger than mine was
taught by Nietzsche that Michael<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Angelo’s greatness was, on the contrary,
due to presiding Renaissance villainy;
but that pseudo-Nietzschian generation
is, in its turn, superannuated, and the
cult of <em>immoralism</em> along with it. Not
only because paradoxes do not bear
repetition, but for another reason which
that quotation from Huxley has made
me realize. Namely, that we have left
off thinking of art as either moral or
immoral, simply because morality no
longer holds the same place in our
thoughts as, say, in those of Ruskin,
George Eliot, or, as that quotation
shows, even in those of Huxley. Not
the same (if one may say so, <em>ubiquitous</em>)
place; a place more clearly defined,
but only the more important, ever since
Intelligence, ferreting about among
<cite>Golden Boughs</cite>, <cite>Religion of the Semites</cite>,
and similar books, has quietly stripped
from our moral valuations that half-supernatural,
half-æsthetic halo which
is but the shrunken religious involucrum
wherein they came into the
world. The “problem of evil” has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
already become the problem not of its
toleration by God, but of its diminution
by Man. <em>That</em> is the great change we
are still witnessing; a change, I cannot
but think, greater than any brought
about by the material applications of
science, and implying a deliverance
from individual suffering not less than
that we owe to Pasteur and to Lister.</p>

<p>Whether we notice it or not, Morality
is already taking a new status, independent
alike of an absentee (or absent)
Deity, and of an indifferent Cosmos.
But its new domain, narrow and self-governing,
essentially <i lang="la">sui generis</i>, has
sanctions and imperatives only the
stronger for being man-made and man-regarding.
And, one may add, only
the more austerely binding on the
present that we shall recognize them as
different from those of the Past and
different, no doubt, from those into
which the Future will transform them.</p>

<p>Thus we are already conceiving of
punishment only as a mechanism,
successful or not, for social defence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
And we scarcely ever hear more than
the last echo of those incentives to
virtue and deterrents from vice of the
<i>Sandford and Merton</i> type of my own
childhood’s copybooks. Still less of
the Stoical, and (alas!) Platonic
mendacities about remorse torturing
evil-doers, and the unhappy life of
Browning’s <cite lang="la">Instans Tyrannus</cite> with his
“Then <em>I</em> was afraid.” Neither do we
talk any longer of the virtuous glows
which (failing the increase of flocks
and herds!) used to reward the virtuous
acts of the generation adorned by
Butler’s Mr. Pontifex. We are getting
to think of our own virtues, supposing
we have any, as conducive not to our
own advantage but to that of other
folk.</p>

<p>Consonantly with the psychologist’s
recognition that, of the two polar
feelings determining human action, the
(positive) attraction of pleasure is far
less potent than the (negative) repulsion
of pain, it seems as if our future ethics
would emphasize not good actions but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
bad ones. That will be following up
the rule-of-thumb wisdom of the Commandments,
of which the surviving
ones are all “thou <em>shalt not</em>”; the
positive ones about loving God and
honouring Father and Mother having
become either difficult to enforce or
optional. I am glad of that word
<em>optional</em>, because it leads to the remark
that Intelligence is surely abolishing
that neutral territory whence “good
actions” can issue at “good” people’s
good pleasure and as an expression of
their goodness, but which no one has
a right to insist upon; indeed, which
they have a perfect right to withhold,
since they are patted on the back for
doing them, or have their hands kissed,
as children were taught to kiss those of
the “revered author of their being.”
I expect that before so very long
Intelligence may bluntly suggest that
if the action, whatever it happen to be,
is <em>really good</em>, that must mean that it is
<em>really needed</em>; and if it is really needed,
your fellow men can claim it and oblige<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
you to claim it from your unwilling
self. And to dishonour that claim
may become in their eyes (mirrored
in your own), mean, disgraceful, dirty.
In the language of contemporary youth,
it will not be <em>decent</em>.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> That substitution
of the word <em>decency</em> for the word
<em>virtue</em> gives, methinks, the clue to the
future revaluation of our moral standards.
It implies, as I have suggested,
a more intelligent and, in some ways,
more indulgent, morality; but a morality
on the whole more austere, a stark
notion of duty armed with the relentless
imperative which nowadays makes us
abashed at the revelation in ourself
of physical cowardice or bodily dirtiness.
A morality, I venture to add,
eventually able to do without the adornments
coming under the head of “Moral
Beauty.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> “No, we may not be as moral as they (<i>i.e.</i>
the older generation) are, but we are fifty times
decenter.”—G. B. Stern, <cite>Tents of Israel</cite>, 1924;
p. 244.</p>

</div>

<p>And, speaking of a future standard of
“decency,” there will necessarily come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
sundry revaluations quite intolerable
to our present morality. I will not
speak (since far too much is nowadays
being spoken concerning what, after
all, is but a small part of conduct)
about such revaluations of sexual morals
as <cite>Dædalus</cite> prognosticates from transplantation
of ovaries. <em>That</em>, and coming
facilitations for changing one’s sex,
cannot, indeed, fail to modify family
arrangements; although I have greater
belief in the effects of future methods
of producing and exchanging, not offspring,
but other commodities, and
the consequent alteration in our tenure
and conception of property. Indissoluble
marriage, which already strikes
some of us as scarcely decent, will lose
its practical utility once inheritance is
more or less abolished, and the subsistence
and education of children no
longer a charge on parents. Nor is this
all: a more restricted practice and
therefore habitual notion of ownership
may at some distant day educate men
and women, parents and children,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
lovers and friends, nay, masters and
disciples, to admit Proteus even into
the impregnable stronghold and inviolable
sanctuary of human selfishness
called <em>Love</em>. The “marriage of
true minds” may, like the other one,
come to be supplemented by honourable
divorce. Exclusive reciprocal
attachment, surely of all spiritual
essences the most delicate, if not most
volatile, may cease to be regarded
as an inalienable piece of property,
guaranteed by honour more terrible
than law; and which, while all else
(and ourselves most!) alters and shifts,
cannot be altered and shifted without
guilt of theft. There may come an
end to the ideal of such fidelity as
implies the claim of him or her once
preferred to be preferred for ever; the
duty also of continuing to prefer once
having begun. Like much of the
morality of a more intelligent age,
“decent” behaviour in matters of
sentiment will be based less upon an
<em>ought</em> than an <em>is</em>. And I can conceive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
that such a change may make love’s
tenure less insecure and less routinish
and perfunctory. It will, at least, save
one of the finest kinds of happiness
(and the multiplying factor of many
other ones) not indeed from the passing
misery of change, but from the ignominy
of claimed or accepted sacrifice,
and the cruel pollution of jealousy, not
between lovers only, but between all
who love. And when there shall be
applied to love the solemn saying “the
Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away”
we may learn to temper our loss by the
intenser gratitude for whatever, even
if only for a time, has been ours.</p>

<p>As with fidelity in love, so also with
“loyalty” to persons, even to causes
and ideas. But such, too often degrading,
loyalty will, I imagine, be
more than compensated for by the condemnation
of a new sin against the
Holy Ghost, and by insistence on a
minimum (at least!) of consistency in
one’s own ideas and a minimum of
conformity between one’s judgment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
others and one’s judgment of oneself:
the mote in one’s brother’s eye awakening
the suspicion of the beam in one’s
own.</p>

<p>At the same time (which is not our
time!), and as Intelligence takes on a
leading part in morals, there will come
the indulgent recognition that such a
“decency” as we may exact (or try
to exact) from ourselves, cannot, any
more than personal cleanliness in our
own day, be exacted from all our
neighbours. It may take a good many
transformations of Proteus before the
mote can always be removed from our
brother’s eye, even supposing the beam
to have been taken away from our own.
It is no easy matter to be always clean
inside and out, especially when, like
the little boy in Stevenson’s rhyme,
“your dear Papa is poor,” poor in
spirit, perchance one of a long line of
moral paupers. Neither is “decency”
always attainable where there has been
no past charwoman to prepare your
easy tidiness at expense of previous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
dirty hands. Still less when, as nowadays,
wallowing in excess or in cruelty
is the only excitement many people
can get out of life. Hence it may be a
long while yet before the bare decencies
of the spirit, even if recognized for
such, can lose the value of rarity and the
status of virtues. For, let us remember
that, the fouler mankind’s surroundings
and sores, the greater the need for
incense and myrrh and even for the
questionable odour of sanctity. Is not
early Christianity’s, say St. Paul’s,
insistence on chastity and mansuetude
the expression of the otherwise inexpressible
bestiality, cruelty, and vaingloriousness
of decadent Rome? And
what is the foolish Franciscan laudation
of beggary save the measure of mediæval
rapine and simony?</p>

<p>So, for the time being and the world
as it may, alas! long continue, mankind
will need something besides a taste for
moral decency, to wit, an admiration
for generous, nay, quixotic impulses
and for tender sensibilities. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
Intelligence, respectful towards the
need for them, can neither create, nor,
except by negative measures, even
increase. But it can do something
as necessary. Intelligence, and only
Intelligence, can see to it that, even
to-day, such rare and precious impulses
and sensibilities be not diverted to evil
results, wasted in barren self-sacrifice,
or the fostering of hide-bound selfishness.
Wasted, above all, in hecatombs
to the Molochs of collective
superstition, like the one which is
only just over, and may begin again
to-morrow.</p>

<small>PROTEUS AND ÆSTHETICS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“If there be any truth in these forecasts
of what your fine Intelligence
may bring about or justify in the
domain of ethics, then” (it’s a certain
kind of reader interrupting), “then
may I never enter, nay, cast a glance
into this detestable world of rationalized
righteousness! <em>Human</em> do you call
it, because you have made it godless?
What is this Intelligence of yours
worth if it fails to perceive that God
exists because Man has need of Him;
and that the true mission of virtue, of
truth, of heroism, is not to make the
world more endurable, but to satisfy
our deepest human craving, that for
greater harmony and loveliness, for
deeper, steadier passion than otherwise
life affords?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>My answer is that such a craving will
become stronger, or at least wider-spread,
in proportion as mankind grows
more intelligent, therefore less exhausted
by struggling against adverse circumstances,
inbred defects and inherited
superstitions. In proportion, likewise,
as it will have learned to value its own
virtues as they can minister to man’s
prosperity and betterment. Nay, more:
the time will come when we shall
turn with disgust and wrath at their
cultivation for any other purpose; and
when pleasure in virtue and in heroism
for its own sake may come to be
accounted so much æsthetic dilettantism,
questionable and well-nigh obsolete.
For with the orientation of morals
towards human usefulness, towards
dutifulness conceived as decency, people
will get to understand that what man
craves for as consolation and enhancement,
the passion deeper and steadier,
the harmony more complete than real
life furnishes, Man creates for himself
in poetry and art, and in the things of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
reality seen as poetry and art. In all
this he has made himself a realm where
truth is never betrayed, because in its
sheer existence <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> become
words without a meaning; moreover,
where the deepest and highest passions
are satisfied without being misapplied
or wasted, because satisfied by their
mere expression. Art and whatever
the poor word <em>Art</em> may stand for—is
the man-made sanctuary of the legitimate,
the innocent, the immaculately
<em>decent</em>, because it is closed to the shifting
<em>needs</em>, the partial truths, above
all, the <em>mine</em> and <em>thine</em>, which trouble
real life. This, in its way, is also a
realm of <em>otherness</em>, inasmuch as it
transcends the self with its <em>here</em> and its
<em>now</em>. Yet an <em>otherwise</em> not merely
recognized by Intelligence, but made
by the heart’s desire out of the heart’s
own substance and in desire’s own
shape; for of such are the forms of
the painter and sculptor, no less than
the counterfeit presentments of the
poet. Above all, in the twin arts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
architecture and of music do we already
meet the clarified embodiment of the
longing and clinging, the solemn appeasement
and victorious stress and
fulfilment of human passion. Here, in
art’s interludes of life, we can obtain
what religious creeds lay open to the
reproach of being false because they
give it for true; and what love seeks
to make unchanging, only to taste the
bitterness of change. So that many as
have been and will be the successive
responses to our æsthetic cravings, the
manifold satisfactions thereof, embodying
as they do the purified essence of
our feelings and activities, will, in the
endless shifting of our valuations, perhaps
constitute the one region where
we need not be watching for Proteus.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br>
<small>PROTEUS AND INTELLECTUAL MANNERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Though many other causes will bring
about such moral revaluations as I have
mentioned, Intelligence will play its
part in justifying them. But Intelligence
will itself effectuate great changes,
methinks, in the minor moral realm of
intellectual manners. For instance,
proscribing <em>perfunctoriness</em>; making us
ashamed, which we are not, of offering
in the guise of opinion much which we
know to be stop-gap and shoddy.
The condemnation of perfunctoriness
will lead to discarding heckler’s tricks
and dialectic pit-falls like that concerning
the future status of the widow
of seven successive husbands, wherewith
the Sadducees, though disbelieving
in any after-life at all, tried to trip up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Jesus. His answer: that there would
be neither marrying nor giving in
marriage, may stand as the typical
silencer to many queries with which
debaters embarrass each other without
advancing a step in the inquiry. For
instance: “then, what do you propose
to do?” Well! we may be intelligent
enough to know that in nine cases out
of ten there <em>is</em> nothing to propose.
Since the more habitually we get to
regard the Future as resulting from the
Present and the Present from the Past,
the more often we must admit that we
know too little of the hidden Past, and
less of the fleeting Present, to make
sure what new combinations, including
reciprocal neutralizations, are preparing
to arise. The oftener we have watched
the Old Man Proteus, the less, perhaps,
our cocksureness about his next
metamorphosis. Or, take another question
which intellectual good breeding
will refrain from because Intelligence
foresees no answer: “In that
case, what will you put in its place?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
<em>It</em> being, let us say, indissoluble marriage,
exclusive private ownership, war
(you remember William James was,
shortly before 1914, looking out for a
<em>surrogate</em>!) or even what used to be
called <em>God</em>, but may now be thankful
when philosophers (like Mr. Lloyd
Morgan) allow it merely adjectival
rank as “<em>Deity</em>.” How do you know
that <em>it</em>, whatever <em>it</em> is, <em>will leave a place</em>?
Do we not daily see that, when things
vanish, their place (place in the world,
in our thoughts, and also, in our
hearts!) are apt to vanish along with
them and be forgotten? And among
such things as may some day vanish
and be forgotten there will, I trust,
be the dialectic ju-jitsu which makes
many pages even of Plato such dreary
reading. Lacking, as the world then
did, all discipline of experimental
science, such acrobatics may have
afforded an indispensable training to
logical thought, and a preparation for
that latest-comer of all intellectual
habits: care for the exact sense in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
which a word is being employed.
Apart, however, from this, controversy
of this kind has but a personal value,
adding nothing to knowledge, just as
nothing is added to wealth when one
gamester loses money to another: the
personal value of downing an adversary
and magnifying oneself by mere comparison,
which may be reckoned in some
distant Future an intellectual entertainment
fit for cads.</p>

<p>Such are a few of the improvements
one might foresee in our intellectual
manners. Allied with these is one
which appertains to our intellectual
morals. In another book<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I have
written at some length against the
survival of the lawyer’s and politician’s
arts of <em>Persuasion</em>, and of the priestly
arts of <em>Exhortation</em> and <em>Denunciation</em>,
both sets of them intended to influence
men to think, feel and act differently
from how they would otherwise do,
but in compliance with the persuasive
person’s wishes. Some day or other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
such attempts may be accounted
impertinent where they fail, and dishonest
where they succeed; they and
the sway of words should constitute a
chapter of intellectual morals.</p>

<p>Returning to mere intellectual
<em>manners</em>, I think intellectual prize
fights, duels and <em>vendettas</em>, such as
wasted half the life of the greatest
intellects from Abélard to Samuel
Butler, are a little going out of fashion,
like the quarrels for precedence we
read about in <cite>Herbert of Cherbury</cite>
and such-like: they stop the traffic,
make a noise and, after a minute, bore
us! Moreover, I fancy I see a reason
why, let alone mere spectators of such
frays, even those who might have been
principals in them will refrain and call
them ill-mannered. I mean that, as
people grow more intelligent, or more
people grow intelligent at all, we shall
discover other opportunities for exercising
intellectual energy and for obtaining
the thrill and uplift of intellectual
prowess. There will appear other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
adversaries to wrestle with and circumvent:
<em>Things</em>, <em>Reasons why</em>, the
Universe’s riddles; not any longer mere
other people trying to make us write
ourselves down asses as we try to make
them. The finest sport in all the world
is hunting Proteus....</p>

<p>Nor will I let myself be heckled with
the objection that joys like these are
reserved for minds like yours and mine,
dear reader, minds <em>Creative</em>....
As if books, pictures, policies, opinions,
etc., etc., were created <i lang="la">ex nihilo</i>, obeying
that august <em>fiat</em> which evolutional
philosophy has filched from the old
Creator of all things to bestow on every
member of the Intelligentsia. No, no,
the joys I speak of are unprofessional.
And the chief creative joy is that of
understanding and appreciating; say
the joy of every deserving reader outrunning
the straight path of the writer
in circles like those of a dog pleased to
be taken a walk.</p>

<p>Amateurishness! I can hear those
of you <em>pshah!</em> and <em>tosh!</em> who believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
in training the (involuntary) attention
and who value work less by results
than by efforts. Amateurish? Why,
of course, that’s just the fun and the
good of it. Also the unsought moral
gain. For, are we not made more
“decent” by these private, irresponsible
dealings with the Unknown (at
least to us); for instance, those secret
inaccurate guesses at geological and
historical riddles which make up half
the pleasure of a journey? Since these
amateurish stalkings of Proteus attain
an attractiveness such that personal
controversy seems insipid or odious by
comparison.</p>

<p>I have had the good fortune once or
twice, even in an old-fashioned lifetime,
to witness the full flowering of such
selfless intellectual happiness: to watch
a mind so passionately interested in
certain subjects as to care nothing
whether the enchanting new ideas were
its own or other folks’; nay, whether
its own were by them confirmed or
utterly demolished. I have seen that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
unusual spectacle, but once or twice
only. For Intelligence has yet to
establish its claim to such generous
happiness. Once or twice only. But
never more clearly have I seen it than
in you, Mario Calderoni, dear dead
young friend, who have embodied my
hopes for the Intelligence of a distant
Future, when you will not have received
a posthumous recognition and I may be
entirely forgotten.</p>

<small>USES AND ABUSES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Considering the great pleasantness,
let alone the various uses, of the
mental habits I have summed up as
<em>Intelligence</em>, it is surprising there should
not yet be more of it forthcoming. It
has, at present, a way of giving out
suddenly in individuals and nations,
just when its mixture of light-hearted
scepticism and steady hopefulness would
seem most needed. By which inadequacy
of its supply I am confirmed in
the suspicion that Intelligence is a
much more recent human accomplishment
than the Past’s other achievements
in art and poetry and wit and
humour would lead us to expect.
Indeed, the deserved prestige of that
Past, and the consequent survival of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
its educational and religious traditions
and institutions, is very likely what has
so strangely delayed the advent of
modern Intelligence. And it is their
dwindling, itself partly attributable
to nascent Intelligence, which has
delivered our intellectual activities from
sundry blind alleys and sloughs of
despond, like those presided over by
the terrible, and most unintelligent,
word <em>Salvation</em>. For Intelligence, one
of whose virtues is abolishing Fear, is
itself stifled by the obsession of danger
in this world or the next: are we not
seeing the most naturally intelligent of
all countries fallen into incredible self-defeating
stupidity through its present
mania for “Security”? It is, of
course, evident that, apart from the
decay of religious and classical superstition,
the growth of Intelligence in our
own days has been enormously fostered
by increase both of scientific knowledge
and of civic liberty, and also, as far as
it goes, of well-being; also of opportunities
for variety of impression at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
least for the well-to-do classes. And
one hopes there may be other kinds of
yet unforeseen novelties coming to
Intelligence’s assistance in the Future.
Yet, the chief obstacles once removed,
my hope is chiefly in what one might
call Intelligence’s own natural proliferation.
One intelligent mode of
thought inevitably leads to another,
and puts out of action an unintelligent
one. Every intelligent book adds, let
us hope, to the intelligence of at least
one reader; so that we could almost
do without the tremendous launchings-forth
of the great challengers, Ruskin,
Tolstoy, Ibsen, Nietzsche; even of the
more purely beneficent (because lighter-hearted)
stirrers-up of thought like
Bernard Shaw.</p>

<p>Believing, therefore, in such spontaneous
multiplication of Intelligence,
I do not find much use for the methods,
whereof that one is but an extreme
example which is attributed to the late
Dr. Metchnikoff, proposing (it is said)
to increase the output of genius by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
judicious doses of syphilitic virus.
Surely, the supply of raw genius would
be fairly adequate if only we could put
it to the best use? And the best use
of genius is not, in my opinion, the
practical application of science to
methods of reciprocal slaughter and
devastation. Nor even its application
to easier locomotion, intercourse and
the cheapening of food, heat and light,
except to the extent which would secure
more health, more leisure and more
opportunity all round; certainly at
present not the case. And, speaking
for myself, the best use of genius and
the most necessary application of
science, seems to be teaching people
what Descartes called (whatever his
precise meaning) the <i lang="fr">méthode de bien
conduire son esprit</i>; at least to the
slight degree of not letting obsolete
shibboleths and new-fangled catchwords
carry us, as they did ten years
ago, headlong into the disasters we
were trying to avoid.</p>

<p>The next best thing to be done with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
our existing supply of genius might be
to train it to check, by application of
common sense and a little modesty,
certain ailments inherent in its own
constitution, namely: exaggeration, contrariness
and, of course, megalomania.
Such self-purification, on the part of
persons of genius or what passes for
such, would save the rest of us the
disheartening task of throwing half of
their sayings onto the scrap-heap, and
of picking out of the scrap-heap some
of the sayings of rival persons of genius
consigned thereunto at their bidding.
There is quite enough to be done in
the way of selection, assimilation and
elimination (since all understanding
means that) without setting such Intelligence
as we have to play scavenger to
wasteful or slatternly genius....
And yet, and yet.... May not
those trashinesses of genius, and the
scavengering entailed thereby, be that
which secures to Intelligence its highest
activities, and in so far fulfils one of
Genius’s chief missions? For, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
all, Intelligence is the living, changing
mass of unprofessional thought, the
averaged, habitual thought of the
majority of us. And is not the chief
use of all such genius as is not set
aside in science or in art, rather to make
the rest of us think, than to furnish us
with ready-made thoughts, however
true or sublime? Nay, I would hazard
the supposition that it was because the
men of the Past were presented with
such a mass of ready-made thoughts,
creeds, philosophies, and moral formulæ
(think of <cite>Deuteronomy</cite>!) all given for
perfect and definitively valid, that
there did not appear till so late in the
day just what I have called <em>Intelligence</em>,
which alone could give that without
which the greatest genius is solitary and
barren: an audience, a reader, a mind
able to carry on the thinking and, in
so far, able to eliminate the deciduous,
the rubbishy elements of the thought
already offered to it.</p>

<p>The consideration of this loss which
mankind may have suffered through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
notion that thoughts must be accepted
ready-made rather than transformed
into one’s own, and that, consequently,
men must be set apart to do the thinking
(as the priests once did the praying
and sacrificing) for others; this consideration
is at the bottom of my present
hatred of the idea (which I shared in
my youth) that exceptionally gifted
persons should consecrate themselves
into a caste, ministers, maybe, of a new
religion, chosen vessels for a new-fangled
deity.</p>

<p>And since we are discussing the
reciprocal uses of Genius and of mere
Intelligence (Genius ever stimulating
Intelligence, Intelligence ever keeping
Genius within the bounds of sense and
of decency), allow me to set my face
against all those oligarchies of genius
and virtue which every Utopian philosopher
from Plato to Comte, from
Renan to H. G. Wells, has wanted to
foist on dull, driven Mankind. And let
us take to heart the <i lang="la">reductio ad
absurdum</i> of all such schemes in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
latest and hugest joke of our one great
laughing philosopher, when he shows
us the world governed by bald, toothless
and passionless sages, who, even
without having reached the years of
Methuselah, have long survived the
age when every decent person should
retire to his or her coffin.</p>

<p>And before leaving the subject of the
services (sometimes scarcely desired)
which Genius may need at the humble
hands of Intelligence, let me point out
how our men of genius or thereabouts
(“Creative Intellects” is the official
expression) have latterly taken over
one of the most remunerative and
mischievous employments of all obsolete
priesthoods, to wit: of frightening
believers with bogies of their
manufacture. For, just as the Torments
of Hell and the Pitfalls of Sin
formerly supplied matter for all the
learning and eloquence of centuries of
Divines, so nowadays encyclopædic
science and journalistic emphasis are
being applied to making our flesh creep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
with prophecies of Perils. There is
Peril from black, brown, yellow races;
from Semites, Mongols, Latins (in
“Nordic” countries), Teutons (in
Latin countries), Celts all over Anglo-Saxondom,
Jews throughout the globe;
Bolsheviks, Fascists and Junkers, International
Communism and International
Finance, Militarism which was put an
end to by the War, besides our old
friends Jesuits and Freemasons. There
is Peril from the multiplication of Idiots
and the multiplication of Supermen;
Peril from depopulation and Peril from
overpopulation, from unsexed women
and over-sexed women; Peril from
over-much altruism, and Peril from insufficient
altruism. Perils which I cannot
even remember, but by whose side
those of War, Pestilence and Famine
are, of course, too familiar to be noticed.
Indeed, it is characteristic of this latter-day
apocalypse that none of the prophets
of disaster prophesied the War and the
Fruits of Victory, except, if I remember
correctly, Mr. H. G. Wells, who, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
once the War had been declared,
enlisted at once for the Fleet Street
Front and bid us unsheath the Sword
of Peace for the final extermination of
Militarism....</p>

<p>Therefore, it strikes me that in view
of this multifold reincarnation of the
spirit of prophecy in our Men of Science
and of Letters, some increase of
Intelligence may well be needed to
steady our nerves and allow us to recognize
the real dangers of which, heaven
knows, there are plenty requiring to be
faced with ... well, the far-too-little
Intelligence already at our disposal.
For, possibly because it is
not “creative” (and <em>creation</em> usually
implies chaos and refuse-heaps), Intelligence
is especially preservative and
sheltering. It is the natural purifier
and tidier-up where Genius and
Stupidity, disrupting and corrupting by
turns, have between them played the
deuce with our poor mortal heritage.
And in the face of the millionfold sacrifices
of self and others which Ideals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
and Heroisms have once again
presented to our foolish admiration,
I would go so far as to add that
Intelligence is often more humane
than Sentiment, and, oftener still,
more beneficent than what we call
Virtue.</p>

<p>From the misapplications of our
Science, the exaggerations and lunacies
of our Genius, and the havoc wrought
by our higher instincts, we therefore
need to be saved, not by Reason, which
is always too long in getting under
weigh, but by Intelligence, active,
alacritous and ubiquitous, afraid neither
of being laughed at nor of laughing
at others.... But even as I
stammer out this old-fashioned demand
for <em>Salvation</em>, the name of Proteus
sounds suddenly in the ear of my spirit.
How can I tell what Proteus may next
be—perhaps already is—changing into?
And after prating about Intelligence
being one-half light-hearted scepticism
and one-half steady confidence, am I
going to join the mixed choir, ecstatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
or growling, of prophesying optimists
and pessimists?</p>

<p>But, though restrained by that
thought of Proteus and his frequently
inconsiderate metamorphoses, I should
like to add a word on one question
regarding the near future of Intelligence,
but with the understanding that
I do so not as a prophet of what may
happen, so much as a witness of half a
century’s already accomplished changes.
The question, or rather query, has
doubtless occurred to some of my
readers, and is as follows: Granted that
Intelligence rids us of dangerous superstitions,
and rids us, moreover, of the
habit of superstition, which is a matter
less of <em>what</em> than of <em>how</em> one believes;
granted that along with lucidity
Intelligence brings also intellectual
equity, cleanness and dignity; granted
all this, may not such gains be paid for
in disproportionate loss? And may not
Intelligence itself constitute a danger?
Has it not already begun despoiling
life of many of the shelters built by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the Ages with unknowing or inspired
hands? Worse still: will it not replace
with its narrow and wavering lucidity
those dark unquestioning instincts and
aspirations, lurking ever ready in the
obscure organization and the mysterious
formulæ inherited from our remotest
ancestors?</p>

<p>To this I would answer that, so far
as my observation tells me, the soul
will always find some shape and some
material wherein to build, or to restore,
the shelters needed in its moments of
weariness and sorrow, there to await
the consolation which no creed seems
to bring without the supreme aid of
time. On the other hand, that the
instinctive part of our nature, when it
is truly instinctive, can surely be
trusted to keep itself alive in the face
of the (alas!) inevitably feeble imperatives
of such new-comers as Reason and
Intelligence. Moreover, that all the
sciences dealing with man point to the
fact that traditional commandments
and, even more, physiologically transmitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
tendencies, have constituted
themselves as responses to changing
environments and needs, so that their
transformation may be expected as a
result of the very movement of things
which has produced them.</p>

<p>And, finally, I would add that, even
if all this were doubtful, we must accept
the risks which the coming of Intelligence
may entail upon us, because (so
at least appears evident to me) whatever
sets-back and temporary overwhelmings
it may suffer in the future,
Intelligence is of such nature that, once
come, it must develop, or at least
bide its time and revive in as yet
unforeseeable manner. And Intelligence
itself must prepare us to expect
that every change may mean a loss, but
likewise mean an opportunity. Perhaps
it may even sometimes show us how
the one can turn into the other; for
does not Intelligence keep an eye on
Proteus?</p>
